# Let's see the data types in action

# a = 24 #Int
# b = 16 #Int
# c = 5.5 #float

# Lets check the boolean values
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)


# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a*c)

# Lets look at some built in methods for boolean
# greetings = 'Hello world!'

# isalpha() helps us find if the variable holding letters
# print(greetings.isalpha())

# islower() checks if the statement is in lower case
# print(greetings.islower())

# endswith() if its ends with something
# print(greetings.endswith('!'))
# print(greetings.startswith('H'))

# in SQL we have seen NULL but in Python we have NONE which is a keyword in python

x = None
print(type(x))
print(x is None)
