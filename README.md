# Control Flow
In Python, the selection statements are also known as Decision control statements or branching statements.

The selection statement allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true.

Some Decision Control Statements are:

- Simple if
- if-else
- nested if
- if-elif-else

**Simple if:** If statements are control flow statements that help us to run a particular code, but only when a certain condition is met or satisfied. A simple if only has one condition to check.

**if-else:** The if-else statement evaluates the condition and will execute the body of if if the test condition is True, but if the condition is False, then the body of else is executed.

**nested if:** Nested if statements are an if statement inside another if statement.

**if-elif-else:** The if-elif-else statement is used to conditionally execute a statement or a block of statements.
