## Interview preparation
1. **TMAY. Tell Me About Yourself**<br>
*Hello 
My name is Oleg<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a graduate electrical engineer
My journey in the technology world started back when I was little. 
At that time I didn't even have a computer, and I used to save every coin in order to go to a computer club.
My invite to the world of technology was through video games.
When I got my first computer I use to break it a lot trying to upgrade and exploit every feature and also squeeze every bit of performance for the games.
I was the IT guy of my family, friends, and relatives when something needed to be fixed or improved.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to choosing a university path, I didn't have a full understanding of what an engineer was but I definitely knew which part of the world is worth it and interesting for me to explore.
Starting the university I already had some foundation in programing.
I still remember the Pascal language.
and electronics which helped me not destroy too many computers while trying to fix or upgrade them.
At university we started with C programming, gradually moving from drawing some shapes in the terminal to control robotic arms and microcontrollers, Arduinos, ESP.
Then we started to dig into how big projects are built, learning about OOP with C++ and also some web development.
Later we explored the part of image processing using Matlab.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was lucky enough to win the Erasmus scholarship 4 times, which gave me the opportunity to combine my studies at several international universities which I can describe as the best part of my life that had a great impact on my personality.
Being part of a great mix of cultures, constantly learning and adapting to new environments, new people, getting out of that comfort zone was the best stimulus to push me forward to develop and always have room for improvement.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a few summer vacations, I was working as an industrial engineer intern at 2 manufacturing companies which helped me integrate in the professional environment learn about best practices and tools when it comes to any project development.
Skills that will help me quickly adapt to any professional environment.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After University I started to think more about getting a role as a junior software developer and learning specific tools regarding web and mobile app development. I started picking up a with Javascript, starting with some frontend tools like react, react-native, and also building some API and linking it to a small backend on NodeJS and a database like Mongo or Postgres.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After quite some time with a lot of interviews and a few successful opportunities and got a great chance which I am very proud of to be part of the Sparta Global academy in the DevOps stream.*<br>
2. **What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?**<br>
3. **Why did you choose Sparta Global?**<br>
4. **What is SCRUM and the benefit of implementing it?**<br>
5. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years' time?**<br>
6. **What is DevOps and the benefit of using it?**<br>
7. **3 Weaknesses**<br> *One of my weaknesses is probably that I am still shy and it might take quite some meditation when it comes to take some decisions.
I would always wait for an invite or call before joining any kind of activity.
But during my education years, I went through a lot of experiences where I had to speak in public, make presentations, lead teams, take initiative, collaborate with a lot of people which helped me to minimize a lot of this aspect.*<br>
*Second I think I am a lazy person. There were so many when I thought that I will always have time to finish a project later and I end up in the last week finishing up the work for some months. 
I started to look for more information about why is this happening cause it was a problem for most of my colleagues and I found out the this is embedded in our DNA. Our brain doesn't like to work on hard projects because it's very resourceful and by using our body is built to conserve any kind of energy.
But in the same books, I found the tools which can help us deal with these issues and forget about procrastination.
Some of those tools are time management, Pomodoro technique.*<br>
