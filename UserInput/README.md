# python_userinput

- Use the input() function to get the data from the user
- store it in a appropriate variable
- use the print() function to output the result
- Python allows for user input.
- That means we are able to ask the user for input.
- The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
- Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
- Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:
```python
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
```
