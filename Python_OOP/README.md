# What is OOP?

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color, but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object.

### Four pillars of OOP with use cases

- **Encapsulation** - packing of data and functions operating on that data into a single component and restricting the any access outside that object.​
  Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object’s definition.​
  A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions,variables etc.

- **Inheritance** - allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.​
  Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.​
  Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.​

- **Abstraction** - Handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. ​
  Enables the user to implement more complex logic without understanding the hidden complexity.​
  Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details.

- **Polymorfism** - means designing objects to share behaviors. Using inheritance, objects can override shared parent behaviors, with specific child behaviors. Polymorphism allows the same method to execute different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.

### Benefits of OOP

- OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures
- Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs
- Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism
- Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them
- Secure, protects information through encapsulation
