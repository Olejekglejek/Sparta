Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

## What is Github?

GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.
