## Soft Skills

1. **TMAY. Tell Me About Yourself**

Hello, My name is Oleg

I am a graduate electrical engineer. Have a big passion for tech, guitars, and sports.Used to lead teams, and like to teach skills at which I am good at. Love traveling did a lot of volunteering activities, started Pascal programming from when I was 12 or 15.
I pursued a university with a network background, a lot of things from electronics, programming, to AI, data analysis.

A few things from my university which I would like to highlight more and which I am proud of most are my success in winning the Erasmus scholarship 4 times which gave me the opportunity to combine my studies at several international universities from Finland, France, Scotland which I can describe as the best part of my life that had a great impact on my personality.
The other important factor was my internship and work placements as a Junior Industrial Engineer at 2 manufacturing companies. It helped me to integrate into the professional environment. Ive also successfully self tought myself fullstack dev and got a job as a Mobile App Dev which I am really really proud of.
And one more thing that I want to point is my final thesis. Where I managed to apply all my knowledge to build a surveillance system with AI features, which I learnd outside of my curriculum.

Here at Sparta I choose DevOps, I find it the best option for me because it combines everything I had a chance to work with, its very vesatile, lots of technology constantly changing career.
This will help to achieve my target which is land and grow a succesfull career in IT.

2. **Why did you choose Sparta Global?**

My target was to get a job as a graduate engineer I was looking closely at companies that focus on hiring graduates. I found Sparta Global popping up quite often in my searches and I started to read more about the company try to contact some people who work there and I also applied for some jobs.

I like the approach Sparta Global took with the academy, teaching the latest skills not in an academic way but in a professional environment that is expected to simulate the day-by-day workflow. It's also very impressive how many graduates were able to land their first steps towards a professional career after this intensive week of training. I find Sparta Global as one of the best kickstarts into a professional world which a graduate can have a the moment and I really wanted to be part of this stream talents.

3. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?**

My main goal is to be very successful and to gain a lot of professional experience in these 2 years with Sparta Global. I want to develop myself in a way that I could take any challenges on board, to learn and understand the whole lifecycle of project development. After this period I would like to continue pursuing this direction, looking for permanent roles and escalating up to a lead/senior position where I wont need any guidance and I could help others achieve their career goals. Depending on the opportunities and requirements of the company I might continue the DevOps path, or I could apply myself to a direction with more programming skills because of the flexibility the DevOps path has but the end goal is to become full-stack and master every skill in my job.

4. **Weaknesses**

In the past I to have an unwanted sense of a perfectionist. For example, sometimes I spend too much time making things right, to follow all the rules and conventions. I could get coath up in any of my activities, for example, the implementation of the code, design, and efficiency, or maybe when I learn something new and get lost in time. I said unwanted because sometimes it's worth looking at the bigger picture.
It's not a big issue anymore because of my passion for psychology and human behavior. So I like to learn how our brain is designed and why certain things happen and also the tools how to overcome or prevent this. Tools like the Pareto Principle, Pomodoro technique, and all sorts of methods helped me to do most of the job with less effort and time and only later focus on details. It helped me to be more efficient, by managing my time and also more self-confident in my decisions and careful when I plan things for the future.

5. **Strengths**

Some of my strengths are Flexibility, I can quickly adapt to changes, can quickly learn new procedures, and most importantly, take on these new changes in an optimistic manner.

I am Team Oriented but also Self-Motivated which helps me to develop the ability to work alone under pressure while enjoying working with groups of people. I am very disciplined without having the need to have the presence of a supervisor, to remind me about my responsibilities although I love to be in an environment of smart people with more experience and knowledge than me, constantly making room for improvement for me.

I am a Problem-solver, love to think about elegant solutions to every problem. I developed this skill from a very young age playing chess, solving riddles, and all sorts of mind-bending challenges.

6. **Can you tell me more about your final thesis?**

In my final thesis, I've built a Surveillance system base on artificial intelligence. As hardware, I used a raspberry pi with its camera module and a doppler radar. The logic was using the neural network in order to recognize objects from a video stream coming from the camera module, the result of the detection could be sent as a notification to our mobile phone using the IFTTT service. Next, we have the functionality to verify the video stream using RaspController app. In case we have a valid detection we have the functionality to control our Rpi with help of Telegram Bots by sending text messages. An example of output could be any peripheral action, Servo Motor, LEDs, audio output. In case the object is not in the view area of the camera module we have the implementation of a doppler radar which can detect movement at 360 and report in the same manner.

7. **How could you benefit the company?**

Add my strengths, my work exprience in manufacturing, team engagement. Very determinant, not giving up, disciplined.

At my previous company, I felt comfortable working under pressure, to pick up new skills in a short period of time which allowed me to deliver my job on time and being able to work and improve my work based on the feedback received. I can help the company by using my strengths and also help others to achieve their own goals and requirements they have to meet. I know I can be valuable support with fresh innovation and always eager to learn and share my experience.

8. **What are 3 areas of improvement for you?**

**Technical skills** - I am currently working on my programming knowledge, how to structure a big codebase using MVC and other design patterns. Also cloud computing, TDD, containerization, and DevOps best practices.

In the past I used to hesitate presenting or take initiative not because I cannot do it.
**Leadership skills** - being confident by taking more initiative and responsibility by advancing in my career. I am working on it by solidifying my knowledge and testing it by explaining and helping others to understand difficult concepts. Myself ive been in so many team and enviroments, with lots of nationalities and cultures, both academic and profesional which helped me to improve myself and work on my personality as well.

**Presentation and delivering skills**, the ability to break down complex things and make them understandable to the majority of people.
That's why I join companies like Sparta Global, attend meetups where I can follow the trends, part which I have to improve, and just build myself as a lifelong learner.

## Agile - Scrum - DevOps

1. **What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?**

Agile is a set of values and principles which help the development team to think and interact in ways to achieve the ability to continuously adapt and constantly make improvements to the way we work.

Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly. Just enough planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets the team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at a minimal cost.

It came as a necessity to replace the Waterfall methodology which was not suitable anymore for large and complex projects.
Agile includes frameworks like Scrum, Extreme programming, Kanban, etc.

It has 4 values that prioritize Individuals and interaction, Working Software, Customer Collaboration, Responsiveness to change rather than Processes and Tools, Comprehensive documentation, Contract Negotiation, and strict plan.

2. **What is SCRUM and the benefit of implementing it?**

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.

There are 5 scrum values which are Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect and Courage. In the scrum team we have the Developers with only one scrum master and one product owner.

We have 5 scrum events: the sprint, sprint planing, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective.

Combined with 3 artifacts which are product backlog, sprint backlog, and increment.

3. **What is DevOps and the benefit of using it?**

DevOps is an software development methodology that combines software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) participating together in the entire service life-cycle, from design through the development process to production, it is a set of practices that automate the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster.

DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of operation team, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools. In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.

4. **Why do you want to become a DevOps Engineer/Consultant?**

I am very passionate about tech and all the different parts of it. Along my journey, I had focused my attention on networks, cybersecurity, and programming. I am also a true fan of Linux and I find that DevOps combines all these parts together. I want to keep on improving these set of skills and DevOps gives me the opportunity to merge all of them and practice them together.

5. **Explain the role of a DevOps Engineer/Consultant**

Developer: New product features, Bug fixes, Security updates, Code refactoring..

Operations: Managing services and products, Monitoring, Grow capacity/Scalability

Deploying from dev to production enviroment warnings and errors accur quite often.

DevOps Principles : Work Together, Automation, Share Responsabilities and Infrastructure as Code.
Engineering Practices : Continous Integration, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment.

1. Developers - Develop/Test the product
2. Store it in Git (Continous Integration)
3. Work with Operations to deploy On premis or Cloud using Infrastucture as Code (also stored in Git)
4. Set up a CI/CD Server to manage this process automatically
5. Moving to pre-production enviroment and test it (Continous Delivery)
6. All of this practictices combined and running test all the way to production (Continous Deployment)

As a Result we have the delivery with faster time to market
Improved team Collaboration
Continous Release Cylcles
Automated scalable enviroments
Increased Quality due to automated Testing

6. **What is cloud computing and why should we use it?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications to storage and processing power, typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for what they use, when they use it.

Cloud computing services cover a vast range of options now, from the basics of storage, networking, and processing power through to natural language processing and artificial intelligence as well as standard office applications, web app, virtual office, IoT, AI. Pretty much any service that doesn't require you to be physically close to the computer hardware that you are using can now be delivered via the cloud.
AWS, Azure, IBM, Google Cloud.

7. **Explain how you implemented DRY - OOP - MVC - MVT - use STAR to answer**

**Model–view–controller** (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

**Don't repeat yourself** (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They apply it quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation". When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements

8. **What are devops practices and importance of them (CI/CD/CDE)?**

DevOps practices reflect the idea of continuous improvement and automation. Many practices focus on one or more development cycle phases. These practices include:

- **Continuous development** This practice spans the planning and coding phases of the DevOps lifecycle. Version-control mechanisms might be involved.
- **Continuous testing** This practice incorporates automated, prescheduled, continued code tests as application code is being written or updated. Such tests can speed the delivery of code to production.
- **Continuous integration (CI)** This practice brings configuration management (CM) tools together with other test and development tools to track how much of the code being developed is ready for production. It involves rapid feedback between testing and development to quickly identify and resolve code issues.
- **Continuous delivery** This practice automates the delivery of code changes, after testing, to a preproduction or staging environment. An staff member might then decide to promote such code changes into production.
- **Continuous deployment (CD)** Similar to continuous delivery, this practice automates the release of new or changed code into production. A company doing continuous deployment might release code or feature changes several times per day. The use of container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, can enable continuous deployment by helping to maintain consistency of the code across different deployment platforms and environments.
- **Continuous monitoring** This practice involves ongoing monitoring of both the code in operation and the underlying infrastructure that supports it. A feedback loop that reports on bugs or issues then makes its way back to development.
- **Infrastructure as code** This practice can be used during various DevOps phases to automate the provisioning of infrastructure required for a software release. Developers add infrastructure “code” from within their existing development tools. For example, developers might create a storage volume on demand from Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift. This practice also allows operations teams to monitor environment configurations, track changes, and simplify the rollback of configurations.

**What is an API?**

**OOP**
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

**SQL What is a Join? DML DDL? Normalization? ERD?**

**MVC MVT?**

**Git & Github**
