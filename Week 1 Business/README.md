## Interview preparation
1. **TMAY. Tell Me About Yourself**

Hello, My name is Oleg

I am a graduate electrical engineer
My journey in the technology world started back when I was little. 
At that time I didn't even have a computer, and I used to save every coin in order to go to a computer club.
My invite to the world of technology was through video games.
When I got my first computer I use to break it a lot trying to upgrade and exploit every feature and also squeeze every bit of performance for the games.
I was the IT guy of my family, friends, and relatives when something needed to be fixed or improved.

When it came to choosing a university path, I didn't have a full understanding of what an engineer was but I definitely knew which part of the world is worth it and interesting for me to explore.
Starting the university I already had some foundation in programming.
I still remember the Pascal language.
and electronics which helped me not destroy too many computers while trying to fix or upgrade them.

At university we started with C programming, gradually moving from drawing some shapes in the terminal to control robotic arms and microcontrollers, Arduinos, ESP.
Then we started to dig into how big projects are built, learning about OOP with C++ and also some web development.
Later we explored the part of image processing using Matlab.
I was lucky enough to win the Erasmus scholarship 4 times, which gave me the opportunity to combine my studies at several international universities which I can describe as the best part of my life that had a great impact on my personality.
Being part of a great mix of cultures, constantly learning and adapting to new environments, new people, getting out of that comfort zone was the best stimulus to push me forward to develop and always have room for improvement.

During a few summer vacations, I was working as an industrial engineer intern at 2 manufacturing companies which helped me integrate into the professional environment learn about best practices and tools when it comes to any project development.
Skills that will help me quickly adapt to any professional environment.

After University I started to think more about getting a role as a junior software developer and learning specific tools regarding web and mobile app development. I started picking up a with Javascript, starting with some frontend tools like react, react-native, and also building some API and linking it to a small backend on NodeJS and a database like Mongo or Postgres.

After quite some time with a lot of interviews and a few successful opportunities and got a great chance which I am very proud of to be part of the Sparta Global academy in the DevOps stream.

2. **What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?**

Agile is a set of values and principles which help the development team to think and interact in ways to achieve agility. Agility is the ability to continuously adapt and constantly make improvements to the way we work.
It includes methodologies like Scrum, Extreme programing (TDD, pair programing), Kanban, etc.
It has a set of tools which are standup meetings, product demos, retrospective, planing poker, user stories, sprints, backlog.


3. **Why did you choose Sparta Global?**

While trying to get a job as a graduate engineer I was looking closely to companies which focus on hiring graduates. I found Sparta Global poping up quite often in my searches and I started to read more about the company try to contact some people who work for the company and I also applied for some jobs. I really like the enviroment here at Sparta Global. I like the aproach Sparta Global took with their academy and its very impresive how may graduates where able to land their first steps towars a profesional career.

4. **What is SCRUM and the benefit of implementing it?**

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.

5. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years' time?**

I hope to be successful and to gain a lot of profesional experience in these 2 years with Sparta Global. After this period I would like to continue the same direction, which might be the same DevOps, or I could switch to direction with more developing skills and to become a senior software engineer.

6. **What is DevOps and the benefit of using it?**

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support. DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of that is required, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools. In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.

7. **3 Weaknesses**

One of my weaknesses is probably that I am still shy and it might take quite some meditation when it comes to take some decisions.
I would always wait for an invite or call before joining any kind of activity.
But during my education years, I went through a lot of experiences where I had to speak in public, make presentations, lead teams, take initiative, collaborate with a lot of people which helped me to minimize a lot of this aspect.

Second I think I am a lazy person. There were so many when I thought that I will always have time to finish a project later and I end up in the last week finishing up the work for some months. 
I started to look for more information about why is this happening cause it was a problem for most of my colleagues and I found out the this is embedded in our DNA. Our brain doesn't like to work on hard projects because it's very resourceful and by using our body is built to conserve any kind of energy.
But in the same books, I found the tools which can help us deal with these issues and forget about procrastination.
Some of those tools are time management, Pomodoro technique.

Third I have sometimes a unwanted sense of a perfectionism. For example sometimes I spend too much time on minor things like playing with the design of a button or navbar. I said unwanted because I
