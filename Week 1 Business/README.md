## Interview preparation
1. **TMAY. Tell Me About Yourself**

Hello, My name is Oleg

I am a graduate electrical engineer
My journey in the technology world started back when I was little. At that time I didn't even have a computer, and I used to save every coin in order to go to a computer club. My invite to the world of technology was through video games.When I got my first computer I use to break it a lot trying to upgrade and exploit every feature and also squeeze every bit of performance for the games.
I was the IT guy of my family, friends, and relatives when something needed to be fixed or improved.

When it came to choosing a university path, I didn't have a full understanding of what an engineer was but I definitely knew which part of the world is worth and would be interesting for me to explore.
Starting the university I already had some foundation in programming.
I still remember the Pascal language.
and electronics which helped me not destroy too many computers while trying to fix or upgrade them.

At university we started with C programming, gradually moving from drawing some shapes in the terminal to control robotic arms and microcontrollers, Arduinos, ESP.
Then we started to dig into how big projects are built, learning about OOP with C++ and also some web development.
Later we explored the part of image processing using Matlab.
I was lucky enough to win the Erasmus scholarship 4 times, which gave me the opportunity to combine my studies at several international universities which I can describe as the best part of my life that had a great impact on my personality.
Being part of a great mix of cultures, constantly learning and adapting to new environments, new people, getting out of that comfort zone was the best stimulus to push me forward to develop and always have room for improvement.

During a few summer vacations, I was working as an industrial engineer intern at 2 manufacturing companies which helped me integrate into the professional environment learn about best practices and tools when it comes to any project development.
Skills that will help me quickly adapt to any professional environment.

After University I started to think more about getting a role as a junior software developer and learning specific tools regarding web and mobile app development. I started picking up a with Javascript, starting with some frontend tools like react, react-native, and also building some API and linking it to a small backend on NodeJS and a database like Mongo or Postgres.

After quite some time with a lot of interviews and a few successful opportunities and got a great chance which I am very proud of to be part of the Sparta Global academy in the DevOps stream.

2. **What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?**

Agile is a set of values and principles which help the development team to think and interact in ways to achieve agility. Agility is the ability to continuously adapt and constantly make improvements to the way we work.
It includes methodologies like Scrum, Extreme programing (TDD, pair programing), Kanban, etc.
It has a set of tools which are standup meetings, product demos, retrospective, planing poker, user stories, sprints, backlog.


3. **Why did you choose Sparta Global?**

While trying to get a job as a graduate engineer I was looking closely to companies which focus on hiring graduates. I found Sparta Global poping up quite often in my searches and I started to read more about the company try to contact some people who work for the company and I also applied for some jobs. I really like the enviroment here at Sparta Global. I like the aproach Sparta Global took with their academy and its very impresive how may graduates where able to land their first steps towars a profesional career.

4. **What is SCRUM and the benefit of implementing it?**

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.

5. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years' time?**

I hope to be successful and to gain a lot of profesional experience in these 2 years with Sparta Global. After this period I would like to continue the same direction, which might be the same DevOps, or I could switch to direction with more developing skills and to become a senior software engineer.

6. **What is DevOps and the benefit of using it?**

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support. DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of that is required, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools. In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.

7. **3 Weaknesses**

One of my weaknesses is probably that I am still shy and it might take quite some meditation when it comes to take some decisions.
I would always wait for an invite or call before joining any kind of activity.
But during my education years, I went through a lot of experiences where I had to speak in public, make presentations, lead teams, take initiative, collaborate with a lot of people which helped me to minimize a lot of this aspect.

Second I think I am a lazy person. There were so many times when I thought that I will always have time to finish a project later and I end up in the last week finishing up the work for some months. 
I started to look for more information about why is this happening cause it was a problem for most of my colleagues and I found out the this is embedded in our DNA. Our brain doesn't like to work on hard projects because it's very resourceful and by design out body is built to conserve any kind of energy.
But in the same books, I found the tools which can help us deal with these issues and forget about procrastination.
Some of those tools are time management, Pomodoro technique.
Thats how I arrived to like studying psycology, and everything related to brain and human behavior.

Third I have sometimes an unwanted sense of a perfectionism. For example sometimes I spend too much time on minor things like playing with the design of a button or navbar. I said unwanted because most of the time we work with deadlines and every minute counts. But during university I learned about Pareto Principle and other tools which helped me to do most of the job with less effort and time and only later focus on details.

9. **3 Strengths**

Some of my strenghts are Flexibility, I can quickly adapt to changes, can quickly learn new procedures, and most importantly, take on these new changes in an optimistic manner.

I am Team Oriented but also Self-Motivated which helps me to develop the ability to work alone under presure, while enjoying working with groups of people. I am very disciplined without having the need to have presence of a supervisor, to remind about me responsabilities altough I love to be in a enviroment of smart people with more experience and knowledge then me, constantly makeing room for improvement for me.

I am a Problem-solver, love to think about elegant solution to every problem. I developed this skill from a very young age playing chess, solving riddles and all sorts of mind-bending challenges.

10. **Can you tell me more about your final thesis?**

Sure, I've build a Surveilance system base on artificial inteligence. As hardware I used a raspberry pi with its camera module and a doppler radar. The logic was collecting the objects which the neural network can recognize with the camera module, the result of the detection could be send as a notification to our mobile phone using IFTTT service. Next we have the functionality to verify the video stream using RaspController app. In case we have a valid detection we have the funcitonality to control our Rpi with help of Telegram Bots by sending text messages. Example of output could be any periferial action, Servo Motor, leds, audio output. In case the object is not in the view area of the cammera module I have implemented a doppler radar which can detect movement at 360 and report in the same manner.

11. **How could you benefit the company?**

I will bring my unique visioning ability to your company. I am experienced in many areas related to this companyâ€™s current goals,
I can contribute my ability to
My previous work experience includes innovation in many areas, including
At my previous company, I devised strategies for improving teamwork and communication among members of team projects. I can bring to your organization not only my ideas from my previous job, but my general passion for innovation too.
Example 1: Administrative assistant
"I excel at multi-tasking in a fast-paced office environment. At my previous job, I managed four executives' schedules and assisted the office manager by opening the office every day, among other tasks as needed. I can do the same job every day, and I can be flexible with a list of different daily tasks that I am handed when I get to work. One of the reasons I applied for this job is because I have been impressed with the culture of productivity and passion for the products you sell. I know I can be a valuable support resource to allow you to prioritize your workload."

Example 2: Project manager
"The last project I worked on at my previous job was the creation of a mobile application that integrated meal planning and supermarket shopping lists. It started out as my simple idea and evolved into a team of eight working on it. We beat our submission deadline by two weeks, and shortly after launch, our application was discussed on an influential cooking podcast. We saw our downloads quadruple that week. I helped our team meet and exceed every deadline and goal, and I believe I can bring that same kind of motivation to this cookbook project."

Example 3: Salesperson
"I discovered how much I love sales during the last year when I was promoted to be a member of the traveling sales team at my last company. After the first six months, I was given the Top Regional Sales Award for signing new clients. Though I enjoyed the challenges of traveling to meet customers in many different locations, I look forward to establishing relationships with some local contacts and offering them my focused efforts. I have used your company's products for years and can give strong testimonials from experience."
