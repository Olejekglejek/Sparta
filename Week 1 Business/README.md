## Soft Skills
1. **TMAY. Tell Me About Yourself**

Hello, My name is Oleg

I am a graduate electrical engineer. Have a big passion for tech, guitars, and sports. Love traveling, did a lot of volunteering activities, and love being involved in interesting projects with enthusiast people.

Starting the university I already had some foundation in programming, with Pascal language and also hardware foundation because I was always looking for ways how to upgrade my computer.

University gave me a solid base in Electronics and Networks. Programing was the most exciting part. We used C for controlling robotic arms and microcontrollers, Arduinos, ESP.
We learned how big projects are built using OOP with C++ and also some web development.
Later we explored the part of image processing using Matlab.

I was lucky enough to win the Erasmus scholarship 4 times, which gave me the opportunity to combine my studies at several international universities which I can describe as the best part of my life that had a great impact on my personality.

During a few summer vacations, I was working as a junior industrial engineer in 2 manufacturing companies which helped me integrate into the professional environment learn about best practices and tools when it comes to any project development.
Skills that will help me quickly adapt to any professional environment.

After university, I was looking for Junior positions in the software development field, and after a lot of attempts, I got a great chance which I am very proud of to be part of the Sparta Global academy in the DevOps stream.

2. **Why did you choose Sparta Global?**

While trying to get a job as a graduate engineer I was looking closely at companies that focus on hiring graduates. I found Sparta Global popping up quite often in my searches and I started to read more about the company try to contact some people who work for the company and I also applied for some jobs. 

I like the approach Sparta Global took with their academy, teaching the latest skills not in an academic way but in a professional environment that is expected to simulate the day-by-day workflow. It's also very impressive how many graduates were able to land their first steps towards a professional career after this intensive week of training. I find Sparta Global as one of the best kickstarts into a professional world which a graduate can have a the moment and I really wanted to be part of this stream talents.


3. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?**

I want to be very successful and to gain a lot of professional experience in these 2 years with Sparta Global. I want to develop myself in a way that I could take any challenges on board, to learn and understand the whole lifecycle of project development. After this period I would like to continue pursuing this direction, looking for permanent roles and escalating up to a senior position. Depending on the opportunities and requirements of the company I might continue the DevOps path, or I could apply myself to direction with more programming skills and to become an engineer in that direction.

4. **Weaknesses**

Sometimes I have an unwanted sense of a perfectionism. For example sometimes I spend too much time making things right, which follow all rules and conventions. I could be the implementation of the code, design and efficiency. I said unwanted because sometime its worth looking at the bigger picture. 
Because of my passion for psychology and human bevior, I found how our brain is designed why certaing things happen and also the tools how to overcome or prevent this. Tools like  Pareto Principle, Pomodoro technique and all sorts of methods which helped me to do most of the job with less effort and time and only later focus on details. I helped to be more efficient, by managing my time and also more self confident in my decisions and careful when I plan things for future.

5. **Strengths**

Some of my strenghts are Flexibility, I can quickly adapt to changes, can quickly learn new procedures, and most importantly, take on these new changes in an optimistic manner.

I am Team Oriented but also Self-Motivated which helps me to develop the ability to work alone under presure, while enjoying working with groups of people. I am very disciplined without having the need to have presence of a supervisor, to remind about me responsabilities altough I love to be in a enviroment of smart people with more experience and knowledge then me, constantly makeing room for improvement for me.

I am a Problem-solver, love to think about elegant solution to every problem. I developed this skill from a very young age playing chess, solving riddles and all sorts of mind-bending challenges.

6. **Can you tell me more about your final thesis?**

Sure, I've build a Surveilance system base on artificial inteligence. As hardware I used a raspberry pi with its camera module and a doppler radar. The logic was collecting the objects which the neural network can recognize with the camera module, the result of the detection could be send as a notification to our mobile phone using IFTTT service. Next we have the functionality to verify the video stream using RaspController app. In case we have a valid detection we have the funcitonality to control our Rpi with help of Telegram Bots by sending text messages. Example of output could be any periferial action, Servo Motor, leds, audio output. In case the object is not in the view area of the cammera module I have implemented a doppler radar which can detect movement at 360 and report in the same manner.

7. **How could you benefit the company?**

I will bring my unique vision and eye to detail to your company. I am experienced in many areas related to this companyâ€™s current goals. I can contribute my ability to all of the project development process.
My previous work experience includes innovation in many areas, including project management, software development, networking, security.

At my previous company, I felt comfortable working under pressure, to pick up new skills in a short period of time which allowed me to deliver my job on time and being able to work and improve my work based on the feedback received. I can bring to your organization not only my ideas from my previous job but my general passion for innovation too. I can help the company by using my strengths and also help others to achieve their own goals and requirements they have to meet. I know I can be valuable support with fresh innovation and always eager to learn and share my experience.


8. **What are 3 areas of improvement for you?**

Technical skills - I am currently working on my programing knowledge, how to structure a big code base using MVC and other design patterns. Also cloud computing, TDD, and DevOps best practices.

Leadership skills - being confident by taking more initiative and responsibility by advancing in my career.

Presentation and delivering skills, the ability to break down complex things and make them understandable to the majority of people.
That's why I join companies like Sparta Global, attend meetups where I can follow the trends, part which I have to improve, and just build myself as a lifelong learner.

## Agile - Scrum - DevOps

1. **What is Agile and the benefit of implementing it?**

Agile is a set of values and principles which help the development team to think and interact in ways to achieve the ability to continuously adapt and constantly make improvements to the way we work.

Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly. Just enough planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets the team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

It came as a necessity to replace the Waterfall methodology which was not suitable anymore for large and complex projects.
Agile includes methodologies like Scrum, Extreme programming, Kanban, etc.

It has 4 values that prioritize Individuals and interaction, Working Software, Customer Collaboration, Responsiveness to change rather than Processes and Tools, Comprehensive documentation, Contract Negotiation, and strict plan.

2. **What is SCRUM and the benefit of implementing it?**

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.

3. **What is DevOps and the benefit of using it?**

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support. DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of that is required, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools. In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.
